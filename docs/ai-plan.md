# StudyWise AI - Google Gemini Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation strategy for integrating Google Gemini AI into StudyWise AI's document-to-test generation workflow. The plan follows the existing application architecture and enhances the current mock AI service with real Gemini capabilities.

## Current Application Workflow Analysis

Based on the codebase analysis, StudyWise AI follows this user journey:
1. **Document Upload** - Users upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
2. **Content Processing** - Text extraction and preprocessing
3. **Test Configuration** - Users specify question types, difficulty, count, and focus areas
4. **AI Generation** - Questions are generated based on content and preferences
5. **Test Taking** - Interactive quiz interface with immediate feedback
6. **Results & Analytics** - Performance tracking and progress monitoring

## AI Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Environment Configuration
- Update `.env.example` and `.env.local` with Gemini-specific variables:
  ```
  VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
  VITE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
  VITE_GEMINI_FLASH_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
  ```

#### 1.2 Enhanced AI Service Architecture

### Phase 4: Optimization & Scaling (Week 6)

#### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Store generated questions for reuse
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple questions in single API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement intelligent request throttling
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance quality with API usage costs

#### 4.2 Error Handling & Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to simpler models or mock data
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery options

#### 4.3 Quality Assurance
- **A/B Testing**: Compare AI-generated vs. manually created questions
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learn from user ratings and corrections
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refine prompts based on performance data
- **Content Validation**: Ensure factual accuracy and relevance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Gemini API Integration

#### Primary Question Generation Prompt Structure:
```
ROLE: Expert educational content creator and assessment designer

TASK: Generate {questionCount} high-quality test questions from the provided content

CONTENT: {documentText}

PARAMETERS:
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Question Types: {questionTypes}
- Subject Focus: {subject}
- Specific Focus: {focus}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each question must be directly answerable from the provided content
2. Include the exact source sentence that supports the correct answer
3. For multiple choice: 4 options, 1 correct, 3 plausible distractors
4. Provide detailed explanations for correct answers
5. Assign appropriate point values (1-5 based on difficulty)
6. Ensure cognitive diversity (recall, comprehension, application, analysis)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Structured JSON with validation metadata
```

#### Validation Prompt Structure:
```
ROLE: Quality assurance specialist for educational assessments

TASK: Validate the accuracy and quality of this question

QUESTION: {question}
OPTIONS: {options}
CORRECT ANSWER: {correctAnswer}
SOURCE CONTENT: {sourceText}

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
1. Is the question clearly answerable from the source content?
2. Is the correct answer definitively correct?
3. Are the distractors plausible but clearly incorrect?
4. Is the difficulty level appropriate?

OUTPUT: YES/NO with brief reasoning
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
class AIService {
  private async generateWithFallback(options: GenerateQuestionsOptions): Promise<AIResponse> {
    try {
      // Primary: Gemini Pro
      return await this.callGeminiPro(options);
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Gemini Pro failed, trying Flash:', error);
      try {
        // Fallback: Gemini Flash
        return await this.callGeminiFlash(options);
      } catch (flashError) {
        console.warn('Gemini Flash failed, using mock:', flashError);
        // Final fallback: Mock data
        return this.generateMockQuestions(options);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
interface CachedQuestions {
  contentHash: string;
  options: GenerateQuestionsOptions;
  questions: GeneratedQuestion[];
  timestamp: number;
  expiresAt: number;
}

class QuestionCache {
  private cache = new Map<string, CachedQuestions>();
  
  getCached(contentHash: string, options: GenerateQuestionsOptions): GeneratedQuestion[] | null {
    // Implementation for intelligent caching
  }
  
  setCached(contentHash: string, options: GenerateQuestionsOptions, questions: GeneratedQuestion[]): void {
    // Implementation for cache storage with expiration
  }
}
```
