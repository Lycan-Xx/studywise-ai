# StudyWise AI: The Intelligent Study Companion

## A Deep Dive into AI-Powered Learning Transformation

### The Vision
StudyWise AI represents a fundamental rethinking of how students interact with their study materials. Rather than the traditional cycle of passive reading, highlighting, and memorization, we've created an intelligent system that actively transforms any document into a personalized learning experience.

### The Core Innovation
At its heart, StudyWise AI is an AI-powered document analysis and question generation engine that understands context, identifies key concepts, and creates meaningful practice questions directly from your source material. This isn't just another quiz app—it's a learning accelerator that makes studying more effective and engaging.

## How It Works: The Intelligence Behind the Scenes

### Multi-Modal Document Processing
The system begins with sophisticated document parsing that handles multiple formats:
- **PDF Processing**: Advanced text extraction with layout preservation
- **Word Documents**: Structure-aware content analysis
- **Markdown/Text**: Semantic understanding of content hierarchy
- **Source Linking**: Every question traces back to its exact origin in your notes

### AI-Powered Question Generation
We employ a multi-provider AI architecture that ensures reliability and quality:

**Primary AI Models:**
- Google Gemini Flash/Pro for fast, accurate question generation
- GPT-4o Mini for complex reasoning tasks
- Claude 3 Haiku for nuanced content analysis
- OpenRouter integration for 200+ model access

**Intelligent Question Types:**
- Multiple Choice (context-aware distractors)
- True/False (logical reasoning based)
- Short Answer (concept extraction)
- Essay prompts (deep understanding assessment)

### Smart Content Analysis
The AI doesn't just read your documents—it understands them:
- **Topic Extraction**: Identifies main themes and subtopics
- **Difficulty Assessment**: Automatically calibrates question complexity
- **Source Attribution**: Links every answer to specific text passages
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains the relationship between concepts

## The Learning Experience

### Personalized Test Creation
Users upload their study materials, and the system:
1. Analyzes document structure and content
2. Extracts key concepts and relationships
3. Generates questions at appropriate difficulty levels
4. Creates comprehensive answer explanations
5. Links everything back to source material

### Real-Time Test Taking
The testing interface provides:
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators
- **Time Management**: Optional timers with warnings
- **Question Navigation**: Flexible movement through test
- **Answer Validation**: Immediate feedback on selections
- **Source References**: Direct links to supporting text
