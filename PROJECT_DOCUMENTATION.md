# StudyWise AI - Project Documentation

## üéØ The Journey of Building an Intelligent Study Assistant

### The Vision: From Frustration to Innovation

It all started with a simple yet profound frustration - the struggle to effectively study and retain information from dense academic materials. As a student myself, I knew the pain of reading through hundreds of pages only to realize I couldn't recall the key concepts during exams. The traditional methods of highlighting and re-reading were inefficient, and existing study tools felt either too simplistic or overly complex.

**StudyWise AI** was born from this need - a smart study companion that could transform any document into interactive, personalized practice tests. The vision was clear: create an application that feels like having a personal tutor who understands your study materials and creates targeted practice questions to reinforce learning.

```

### üöÄ Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Document Processing Engine
The heart of StudyWise AI is its ability to process various document formats:

```typescript
// Supported formats: PDF, TXT, Markdown, DOCX
const processDocument = async (file: File) => {
  const text = await extractText(file);
  return generateQuestions(text);
};
```

**Technical Challenge**: PDF parsing proved particularly tricky due to PDF.js worker configuration issues. The initial implementation struggled with MIME type errors and fake worker fallbacks.

**Solution**: Implemented a hybrid strategy:
- **Development**: Uses local worker file for consistency
- **Production**: Leverages CDN for performance and caching
- **Fallback**: Comprehensive error handling with debug logging

#### 2. Intelligent Test Generation
The application creates realistic practice questions with:
- Multiple choice questions
- True/false questions
- Fill-in-the-blank questions
- Source text linking for context

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  type: 'multiple_choice' | 'true_false' | 'fill_blank';
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: string;
  sourceText: string;
}
```

#### 3. State Management Architecture
Built a robust state management system using Zustand:

```typescript
// Core stores for different application states
const useTestStore = create<TestState>()(...);
const useLibraryStore = create<LibraryState>()(...);
const useTestSessionStore = create<TestSessionState>()(...);
const useResultsStore = create<ResultsState>()(...);
```

**Key Insight**: Zustand's simplicity combined with localStorage persistence created a seamless user experience where tests and progress are preserved across sessions.

#### 4. Responsive UI Design
Leveraged Tailwind CSS and Radix UI to create:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible components with proper ARIA labels
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Consistent design system with custom color palette

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: PDF.js Worker Configuration
**The Problem**: PDF parsing failed with cryptic MIME type errors and fake worker fallbacks, preventing document processing.

**The Journey**: 
1. Initially tried using the default PDF.js configuration
2. Encountered version compatibility issues between core and worker
3. Experimented with different CDN versions and local file serving
4. Discovered the need for explicit worker configuration

**The Solution**:
```typescript
// Hybrid worker configuration strategy
const workerConfig = {
  workerSrc: import.meta.env.PROD
    ? `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/3.11.174/pdf.worker.min.js`
    : `/pdf.worker.min.mjs`
};
```

#### Challenge 2: State Persistence Across Sessions
**The Problem**: Users expected their test progress and library to persist between browser sessions.

**The Solution**: Implemented Zustand persist middleware with localStorage:
```typescript
create<TestSessionState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // state definitions
    }),
    {
      name: 'test-session-storage',
    }
  )
);
```

#### Challenge 3: Real-time Test Timer
**The Problem**: Creating a reliable countdown timer that works across component re-renders and persists state.

**The Solution**: Used Zustand for timer state management with useEffect cleanup:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (timeRemaining > 0) {
      set({ timeRemaining: timeRemaining - 1 });
    } else {
      handleTestCompletion();
    }
  }, 1000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [timeRemaining]);
```

#### Challenge 4: Responsive Design for Test Interface
**The Problem**: Creating a test interface that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**The Solution**: Tailwind CSS responsive utilities with mobile-first approach:
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row h-screen">
  <div className="w-full md:w-3/4 p-4">
    {/* Question content */}
  </div>
  <div className="w-full md:w-1/4 border-t md:border-t-0 md:border-l">
    {/* Navigation sidebar */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### üìä Mock AI Implementation

Since this is a demonstration project, the AI question generation is implemented as a mock service that creates realistic-looking questions based on document content patterns:

```typescript
const generateMockQuestions = (text: string): Question[] => {
  // Analyze text structure and create relevant questions
  // Uses patterns like definitions, lists, and key concepts
  // Returns array of questions with plausible options
};
```

This approach allows showcasing the full user experience without requiring actual AI API integration.

### üöÄ Deployment and Setup

#### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

#### Netlify Deployment
The project is configured for seamless Netlify deployment:
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist/public`
- Node version: 18
- SPA-friendly redirects

components/
  test/
    TestWizard.tsx      # Multi-step configuration
    TestTaking.tsx      # Full-screen test interface
    TestResults.tsx     # Results display
    // ... other test-related components
```

#### 2. State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Use descriptive store names and clear state boundaries
const useTestStore = create<TestState>()(...);       // Test configuration
const useTestSessionStore = create<TestSessionState>()(...); // Active test
const useLibraryStore = create<LibraryState>()(...); // Saved tests
```

#### 3. Type Safety
```typescript
// Comprehensive type definitions for all data structures
interface TestConfig {
  questionCount: number;
  questionTypes: QuestionType[];
  timeLimit?: number;
  sourceText: string;
}
```

#### 4. Error Handling
```typescript
// Graceful error handling throughout the application
try {
  await processDocument(file);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Document processing failed:', error);
  toast.error('Failed to process document. Please try again.');
}
```
